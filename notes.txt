Progress throughout this project:

* Learned how to cache a public api as a local .json file using python
* Able to query local .json file
* Ran a Python program which iterated through the json and downloaded the image 
  associated with each card, so that all the card images can be stored locally and 
  API calls are no longer necessary to pull card pics
* Learned how to lazy load so that components aren't rendered until they are needed
* Used AWS S3 to host over 25,000 images of yugioh cards
* Learned how to use debouncing in a search bar to optimize performance
